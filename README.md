A **To-Do List App** is a simple task manager where users can add, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks.
This version stores tasks in **localStorage**, so they remain after closing the browser.
It also has filters (*All*, *Active*, *Completed*), a “Clear Completed” button, and a small 🔥 streak tracker for daily usage.
